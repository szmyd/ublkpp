// Brief: Test that RAID0 devices correctly report paramaters based on Devices A and B
//
// Construct a RAID0 device with Differing underlying devices that deviate on every
// parameter. The final RAID0 parameters should represent the lowest feature set of
// both devices including Capacity, BlockSize, Discard and DirectI/O support.
